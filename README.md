<p align = "center" > A posterized video chatting application which uses <a href = "https://github.com/sivaramakrishnan1/GraphEncryption-CSharp/blob/master/NS2Algorithm/Form1.cs" > 2NS graph encryption </a>. </p>

## Idea
Many chatting app introduced stickers, animated stickers, one-time viewing media (Mostly like snapchat). So I thought, why can't there be one-time-only viewing sticker which is video with audio compressed in size by reducing the number of colors. A frame minimized colors effect is called as posterized image and this project will create a posterized videos as chatting materials. Just like sticker, only the person will be recorded. Like a PNG Video.
